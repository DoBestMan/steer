        '<h2>Information Collected</h2>\n<p>\n  We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Services. We may also supplement this information with information from other companies. We collect two general types of information, namely personal information and aggregate data. As used in this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and email address), and demographic and other information when directly linked to information that can identify an individual.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The following are the specific types of information we collect from you.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Information You Give Us. We collect information you give us on our Site, and when you register for and use our Services. Examples include the following:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Registration and Profile Information. When you register to use our Services or update your profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you including, your name and email address; your title, company and other profile information you provide; demographic information; and information you upload like photos, files, and documents.\n      </li>\n      <li>Contact Information. We collect the email addresses you provide for contacts you enter or upload into your private contacts page. When you choose to collaborate or share files with others, we also collect email addresses you provide to email invitations to those individuals on your behalf.</li>\n      <li>Device and Activity Information. When you use your Device with the Site, data recorded on your Device about your activity is transferred from your Device to our servers. This data is stored and used to provide the Service and is associated with your account. We also collect information about any rehabilitee protocols you may be using.</li>\n      <li>Payment Information. If you choose to use a paid Client account or service, our payment processing vendor collects your credit card information and billing address.</li>\n      <li>Submissions and Client Service. From time to time we may use surveys, contests or sweepstakes requesting personal or demographic information and customer feedback.</li>\n      <li>Automatically Collected Information. We automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Services. For example, it is standard for your web browser to automatically send information to every web site you visit, including ours. That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring web site addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files and pages accessed or used by you.</li>\n      <li>Cookies and web Beacons. We may also use certain kinds of technology such as cookies and web beacons to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies and web beacons enables us to improve our Site and emails by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our web site, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount of data which is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify your browser setting to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie by editing your browser options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the web site and services may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain web page features or services. A web beacon is an electronic image, also called a "gif," that may be used on our web pages to deliver cookies, count visits and compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness or in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</li>\n      <li>Aggregrate Data. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Services.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>',
